# learn-to-count
Vanilla JS app for learning to count in other languages

Learning to count in new languages is hard.

I made this app to try and make it easier.

Current languages
* Japanese
* Korean
* Chinese

I think it's okay, but of course it could be better, so if you want to make fix or addition just submit a pull request and if it improves the app in any way I'll gladly merge it in!
